# latex_vlna_script
Latex script supposed to add tildes (~) in text to every .tex file in folder (and in subfolders). Ignores maths and verbatins. Ignores in default files called "appendix", "literature" and "main".

# Known problems
If path of .tex file is longer than circa 120 characters, file will be ignored.
